As a result, professional advisors must review the options available to accumulate, grow, preserve and transition wealth appropriately to individuals, corporations and inter vivos as well as testamentary trusts. This workshop is designed to be both a primer on taxation of trusts and estates and strategic think tank for advanced planning opportunities for peers in the tax and financial services from coast to coast.\r\n\r\nWhy this is timely:\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2016, the graduated tax rates currently available to testamentary trusts will only apply for the first three years of the trust.  For testamentary trusts that continue beyond three years, the rate applied to income taxed in the trust will be the highest tax rate (currently 29% federally).  Inter vivos trusts will be taxed at the flat 29% rate with no three-year delay. The only exception to this rule will occur in the case of trusts set up for people qualifying for the federal Disability Tax Credit. Professional tax and wealth advisors need to be ready to plan for these changes in their practices.\r\n\r\nKey Benefits:\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn how individual, corporate and trust structures can assist in helping families plan for intergenerational wealth creation and transition. There will be a special emphasis on the tax-efficient transfers of assets during lifetime, at times of incapacity and at death and beyond to ensure that multiple lifetimes of asset-building are sustained.\r\n\r\nCourse Components:\r\n\r\nThis one‐day workshop is delivered with three components; pre-reading, in-class session, and a post-session online course component (the latter is optional).\r\n\r\nThe all inclusive workshop fess also include lunch, coffee, and snacks as well as accreditation for CE/CPD purposes and certification. Earn up to 30 CE/CPD credits, as detailed below.\r\n\r\nPre-Reading\r\n\r\nEarn 3.5 CE/CPD credits. Do pre-session reading in EverGreen Explanatory Notes.

The process and the results of the collective agreement have the potential to destroy the relationship between the parties. It can also alter how effectively Management can manage its workplace, as well as the Union’s ability to represent the interests of its members. Ultimately, this single business contract can lead to the success or the demise of the organization, and the viability of the membership. How this process is managed and the resulting collective agreement will determine your success.\n\nCollective bargaining is a complex process between two opposing interests. On one side, you have Management who must meet organizational and financial objectives. They must ensure the profitability and even survivability of their organization. Increases in labour budgets and limitations on their management rights can, in some circumstances, lead to the demise of the organization. On the other side, the Union, by legislation, must protect not only the economic welfare of its members, but must ensure that employees are treated fairly and that they work in a safe environment. Failure to properly represent its members can also jeopardize the strength of a Union.\n\nIt is the role of a skilled negotiator to bridge the gap between these two positions. It is the successful negotiator that will move the discussions from a position of resistance and opposing demands, to a position of mutual agreement and a concluded collective agreement. Whether you are assisting with negotiations in the back room, will be negotiating for the first time, or have concluded agreements in the past, this three day program will give you strategies and skills that Chief Negotiators for national and Fortune 500 companies use at the bargaining table.

Each team will then determine their approach and strategy, which articles require modifying, and their strike/lockout positions.\n\nUnion and Management will meet throughout the day to exchange proposals.

In some situations, the win or loss of an arbitration can completely change the culture and the perceived rights of Management or Union. Therefore, it is in the best interest of both parties to resolve disputes as quickly as possible. However, in some circumstances if you must defend a business decision, and take a grievance to arbitration then you must be prepared to win.\n\nThis three day comprehensive program will highlight the considerations that you first need to make before you take a grievance to arbitration. Have you exhausted all of the available options for a settlement? Or is this a business or principled decision that requires the award of an Arbitrator? Have you considered both mitigating and aggravating factors? In this program, you will learn how to use the grievance process to resolve disputes.\n\nIf arbitration becomes the only option, then you must be prepared to WIN. Learn what documents are required to build your defense, how to develop a ‘theory’ for your position, and how to use case law. Learn how to develop questions in order to ensure that the responses will support your argument. Learn that witness preparation is crucial, as their testimony can potentially destroy the credibility of your case.\n\nOn the third day of this program, you will participate in an arbitration hearing simulation; however, the case and facts are real. The outcome of this arbitration will be decided upon your preparation, your presentation skills and your ability to convince the Arbitrator.

Representing either Management or Union, your team will develop the theory of your case, which will be supported by case law. You will also request a remedy from the Arbitrator that should be consistent and in keeping with the merits of your argument and theory.\n\nDuring this simulation, you will have the opportunity to role-play – to take the stand as a witness or the grievor. Your team will develop and present the opening arguments, which must also be consistent with the facts that will be brought forward by the witnesses.

Poor leadership is often at the forefront of disastrous processes. How can leaders promote quality assurance, develop human capital and support innovation, but not bother to invest in their own continuous learning? Have you ever wondered why great leaders are the few and not the many?\n\nThis program will highlight key components of successful leadership that are common in all great leaders. You will learn effective strategic and operational decision making skills within ever-changing environments that have converging and competing variables in demanding pressures of time, risk, and reward. Great leaders also build contingencies and flexibility in each decision as they understand that there are many paths to success, some of which are not under their control. Equally critical is your ability to develop leaders at every level. Through focused and deliberate communication strategies, you can build a performance-based organization by fostering a culture of innovation, purpose, and drive.\n\nGreat leaders have the strategic capacity and vision to position their organization in order to take advantage of circumstances that may not have been forecasted. They have the ability to predict turning points and have the agility to reposition their organization. This ability to envision a future in the present by utilizing a methodological approach may determine the very economic viability, or sustainability of your organization.\n\nIn this three day program, through discussions and case studies, you will learn effective strategies that will immediately enhance your leadership skills.

Issues of insubordination, absenteeism, poor attitude, and harassment are only some of the many workplace issues that face every supervisor and manager at one point or another in their careers. The reality is that most managers of people have had very little formal training on how to legally and effectively handle these situations, leaving them feeling helpless. These situations are further complicated by ‘game players.’ Without active management, poor sub-cultures form followed by poisoned work environments.\n\nMost of us during our career have worked in organizations that have had issues that destroyed morale, impeded performance and stifled creativity. We saw good employees leave while poor ones stayed, festering even more and perpetuating the toxic environment. We often wonder why these situations even begin, are allowed to continue, and simply why the organization doesn''t do something about it.\n\nThe answer is simple—organizations aren''t equipped to deal with these types of issues, managers aren''t trained and therefore without any guidance, they ignore these situations as well as these poor employees. Workplace rules are nothing but mere guidelines only to be followed if they feel like it. A 7 am start is not a 7 am start....it''s 7ish, dismissing your supervisor’s instruction is tolerated and doing the least amount of work for the most amount of money is applauded.\n\nIt''s only when you know your employer’s rights, responsibilities, and obligations can you help right the ship and start to reduce the conflict that occurs in the workplace. Your good employees are waiting for you to act, and if you don’t they will jump ship. Managers need to be able to handle these types of issues and feel confident that they are doing the right things.

These stories also describe the features required by the users, and are defined in clear and lucid terms. Following this methodical approach ensures the rest of the project can be strategically put in place.\n\nAgile methodology was formed out of the need to find an effective new process that could replace conventional methods of software development, like the waterfall method, which were inherently prone to problems. Agile methods add flexibility to the development process, providing opportunities to assess and alter the direction of the project as it evolves.\n\nUser story workshops are held near the beginning of the project, with all team members participating and creating a product backlog that captures all the user perspectives and lays out all the functionality to be added till project completion. At each stage, user stories will absorb the changes that have been necessitated during the evolution of the project.\n\nOur one day course in Agile User Stories Training will teach you the basics of this technique for expressing requirements as user stories, and will give you tips and guidelines for writing an effective user story. You will learn the basic components that stories must comprise of, and get tools that will help you to be clear and concise in your expression.
