										<li>To encourage professional development, we typically ask our interns to spend 10-25% of their time on developing their own growth project (for example, video campaign, partnerships, other growth ideas) - top projects may be selected and executed on a company-wide basis</li>
									</ul>
									<strong>Requirements:</strong>
