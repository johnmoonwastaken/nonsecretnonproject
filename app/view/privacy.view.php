						<p><h4>Trainingful (the Service) is owned and operated by trainingful, inc. ( we/us) and is committed to protecting the privacy of our users (you). We aim to provide you a secure online experience and to ensure that any information you submit to us is private and used/disclosed only for the purposes and in the means described below.</h4></p>
						<p><h3>We’re here so you can find reviews and information on courses and conferences</h3></p>
						<p><h4>The Service is an online training course search and rating website and will require professionals seeking training (“professionals”) and training providers (“providers”) to submit various information in order to conduct and optimize the training course search and rating process. All information about professionals is submitted exclusively on a voluntary basis. Some provider and course information may be collected from publicly available data on the internet.</h4></p>

						<p><h4>To fully participate in the Service, we require you to register as a member, either as a professional or as a provider.<br /><br />
To register, we will ask for personal/contact information (professionals and providers) and information about your company (providers). trainingful is the sole owner of information collected on the registration pages and we will not disclose this information to anyone outside of the Service without your permission.<br /><br />
Furthermore, in order to ensure that reviews are genuine and of high quality, we ask that professionals verify their trainingful accounts by linking to professional social networking services such as Linkedin. In order to present your reviews for viewing by other professionals and by providers, we may provide such users a limited amount of information about you, including your verification status, a link to your professional social networking profile (if you have provided it), and any information about any other reviews you have submitted to trainingful.<br /><br />
