						<p><h4>Trainingful (the Service) is owned and operated by Trainingful, Inc.  ( we/us) and is committed to protecting the privacy of our users (you). We aim to provide you a secure online experience and to ensure that any information you submit to us is private and used/disclosed only for the purposes and in the means described below.</h4></p>
						<p><h3>we’re here so you can find reviews and information on courses and conferences</h3></p>
						<p><h4>The Service is an online training course search and rating website and will require professionals seeking training (“professionals”) and training providers (“providers”) to submit various information in order to conduct and optimize the training course search and rating process. All information about professionals is submitted exclusively on a voluntary basis. Some provider and course information may be collected from publicly available data on the internet.</h4></p>
						<p><h3>we won’t tell anyone else you registered with us unless you let us</h3></p>
						<p><h4>To fully participate in the Service, we require you to register as a member, either as a professional or as a provider.<br /><br />
To register, we will ask for personal/contact information (professionals and providers) and information about your company (providers). Trainingful is the sole owner of information collected on the registration pages and we will not disclose this information to anyone outside of the Service.<br /><br />
Furthermore, in order to ensure that reviews are genuine and of high quality, we ask that professionals verify their Trainingful accounts by linking to professional social networking services such as Linkedin. In order to present your reviews for viewing by other professionals and by providers, we may provide such users a limited amount of information about you, including your verification status, a link to your professional social networking profile (if you have provided it), and any information about any other reviews you have submitted to Trainingful.<br /><br />
From time to time, we may contact you about any features/services on our site which we believe may be of interest to you. Our goal is to provide you with a personalized experience every time you log onto the Service, and to that end we may direct you to courses and other website features that we think may assist you in your professional training activities.</h4></p>
						<p><h3>obviously, training providers will get your registration info to contact you</h3></p>
						<p><h4>When you sign up for courses with training provider(s) through Trainingful, Trainingful will forward your personal contact information to the relevant provider(s) so that you can be registered for the courses and so that those provider(s) can contact you.</h4></p>
						<p><h3>let us get to know you just a little bit!</h3></p>
						<p><h4>We require certain information from you,  such as your full name and contact information, as part of your participation in the Service. If you do not wish to participate in this service and benefit from the training and professional development activities that the Service provides, or if you do not wish to disclose the information that we require from you to participate in the Service, then please do not enter your personal information into the website. We may ask for some information on a voluntary basis, such as your reviews and ratings of vendors and courses. The disclosure of such information is not required to participate in the other parts of the Service.<br /><br />

You may edit/change/amend the information in your personal profile at any point in time. </h4></p>
						<p><h3>where's your data at?</h3></p>
						<p><h4>Information obtained by the site is used only for the intended purposes stated. It is the Company's policy not to sell or share your personal information for related or unrelated purposes to non-licensed third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. However, we may collect and use usage statistics including anonymized data regarding individual users, and may also disclose such data to trusted partners as part of our effort to better understand your training needs and preferences, but only in an anonymized form.</h4></p>
						<p><h3>when you’re putting your course online, it’ll become really public!</h3></p>
						<p><h4>Providers are asked to submit detailed contact information and information about the courses provided as part of their partnership with us. Information is submitted on a voluntarily basis and may also be collected from publicly available sources such as the providers’ own websites.<br /><br />
Course details may be viewed by any users of the website, even without registration or verification. However, only professionals who have registered and verified their accounts may write reviews for courses taken. <br /><br />
Providers may enter details regarding themselves and may enter data regarding new courses and sessions, but may not delete old courses or sessions. Courses and sessions which have been canceled may be put into 'inactive' status.</h4></p>
						<p><h3>we will link to the outside world and there may be monsters out there...</h3></p>
						<p><h4>Please be aware that the Service  contains links to third-party websites. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, nor are we responsible for, any content, privacy practices, or conduct by third-party websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policies of each and every website including those that collect personally identifiable information.</h4></p>

						<p><h4>Cookies are packets of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow us provide you with a personalized website experience based on your prior registration and activities on the Service. No secure information or information about your personal identity is ever contained within our cookies. Your web browser is most likely set to automatically accept cookies, but you can consult your browser help file if you wish to change these settings.

						<p><h3>if we need to use your data in another way, we’ll ask you</h3></p>
						<p><h4>If at any time we decide to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will endeavor to notify you and give you a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.<br /><br />
No notification nor consent will be sought if we are compelled or required by applicable law, statute, regulation, ordinance, or court order to disclose personal data<br /><br />
We  will continue to commit ourselves to protecting our users' privacy. Any changes/enhancements in our privacy practices will be updated as soon as possible on this page.</h4></p>
